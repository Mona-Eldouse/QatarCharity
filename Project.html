          Millions of children die every year before the age of 5, mostly from preventable causes. Also, thousands of women lose
          their lives every day due to pregnancy or childbirth complications. About half of births in rural areas are not
          performed by specialized medical professionals. This is due to lack of primary health care facilities, lack of qualified
          healthcare providers, high cost of medical treatment in addition to the spread of infectious, endemic, and chronic
          diseases.<br>

          The right to adequate housing is a basic human right recognized by all the international laws. The United Nations
          Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has stated that the right to proper adequate housing should not be
          interpreted narrowly, it should be rather perceived as the right to live somewhere in security, peace, and dignity.
          Despite the importance of this right in every country&rsquo;s legal system, the statistics reveal that almost one
          billion people are not properly housed around the world, while there are millions of people who live in life threatening
          conditions, in overcrowded slums and urban jungles. Millions other evict, flee, and leave their houses to become
          homeless due to wars, conflicts, epidemics, and natural disasters.

    Water scarcity affects millions of people around the world, and the alarming figures are projected to increase due to
    the rise of global temperatures because of climate change. Also, women and children mostly bear the responsibility of
    sourcing and carrying their daily water supply. Additionally, school attendance rates among female students tend to
    decline due to lack of sanitation facilities.</div>

      Recent global data show that there are more than 300 million out-of-school children, mostly in communities affected by
      fragility and conflict. This phenomenon is also due to several interlinked challenges, including lack of education
      facilities, lack of qualified educational staff, and lack of a safe and convenient education environment

      Masjid (the Mosque) is considered to be the community centre for Muslims. It represents the heart of the Muslim family
      and community. In Qatar Charity, we make sure to fund the construction of mosques all around the world, knowing that
      mosques are not only used for prayers, Quran recitations and Islamic discussions but it is also the place where Islamic
      &amp; social ceremonies are held. Donate and give sadaqah to the Mosque Building Fund!
